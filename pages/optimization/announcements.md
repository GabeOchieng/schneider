Updating Competition Metric


After a thoughtful discussion in the forum, we are updating the official evaluation metric to be more useful. The new metric is [now available in the competition repo](https://github.com/drivendataorg/power-laws-optimization/commit/92e9c8f99eddc2406c8d95121ab6151b62ee136f).

Competitors may notice that scores from their submissions so far have been removed since they are no longer accurate. If you want to resubmit any runs you have done, we've increased the daily limit for the competition. You can either recalculate the final column in the submission format manually based on the new metric or re-run your simulation with the latest code.

Thanks to all the participants, and good luck!
